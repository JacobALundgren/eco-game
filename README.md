Yet-unnamed economy simulation game

Two ideas constitute the core of this game:

1. Resources are traded according to market principles, with supply and demand simulated to establish prices.
2. Players are able to interact with the game both manually through a graphical interface, as well as through
   automation via an API.

Resources can be refined and converted in order to add value. Many pieces on the side of available actions still
need to be figured out in order to make the game attractive as a game and not simply an exercise in simulation or
automation.

It should be possible to specify restrictions, delays or similar drawbacks to using the API, so that the game can be
played either fully interactively, fully automatically or in some form of combination. Most likely it would also be
desirable to have the ability to set up automation in a simple way in the graphical interface, to appeal to people
less comfortable or familiar with programming.
